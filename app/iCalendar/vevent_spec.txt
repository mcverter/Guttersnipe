RFC 5545                       iCalendar                  September 2009


Component Name:  VEVENT

   Purpose:  Provide a grouping of component properties that describe an
      event.

   Format Definition:  A "VEVENT" calendar component is defined by the
      following notation:

       eventc     = "BEGIN" ":" "VEVENT" CRLF
                    eventprop *alarmc
                    "END" ":" "VEVENT" CRLF

       eventprop  = *(
                  ;
                  ; The following are REQUIRED,
                  ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                  ;
                  dtstamp / uid /
                  ;
                  ; The following is REQUIRED if the component
                  ; appears in an iCalendar object that doesn't
                  ; specify the "METHOD" property; otherwise, it
                  ; is OPTIONAL; in any case, it MUST NOT occur
                  ; more than once.
                  ;
                  dtstart /
                  ;
                  ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                  ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                  ;

                  last-mod / location / organizer / priority /
                  seq / status / summary / transp /
                  url / recurid /
                  ;
                  ; The following is OPTIONAL,
                  ; but SHOULD NOT occur more than once.
                  ;
                  rrule /
                  ;
                  ; Either 'dtend' or 'duration' MAY appear in
                  ; a 'eventprop', but 'dtend' and 'duration'
                  ; MUST NOT occur in the same 'eventprop'.
                  ;
                  dtend / duration /
                  ;
                  ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                  ; and MAY occur more than once.
                  ;
                  attach / attendee / categories / comment /
                  contact / exdate / rstatus / related /
                  resources / rdate / x-prop / iana-prop

                  )

   Description:  A "VEVENT" calendar component is a grouping of
      component properties, possibly including "VALARM" calendar
      components, that represents a scheduled amount of time on a
      calendar.  For example, it can be an activity; such as a one-hour
      long, department meeting from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, tomorrow.
      Generally, an event will take up time on an individual calendar.
      Hence, the event will appear as an opaque interval in a search for
      busy time.  Alternately, the event can have its Time Transparency
      set to "TRANSPARENT" in order to prevent blocking of the event in
      searches for busy time.

      The "VEVENT" is also the calendar component used to specify an
      anniversary or daily reminder within a calendar.  These events
      have a DATE value type for the "DTSTART" property instead of the
      default value type of DATE-TIME.  If such a "VEVENT" has a "DTEND"
      property, it MUST be specified as a DATE value also.  The
      anniversary type of "VEVENT" can span more than one date (i.e.,
      "DTEND" property value is set to a calendar date after the
      "DTSTART" property value).  If such a "VEVENT" has a "DURATION"
      property, it MUST be specified as a "dur-day" or "dur-week" value.

      The "DTSTART" property for a "VEVENT" specifies the inclusive
      start of the event.  For recurring events, it also specifies the
      very first instance in the recurrence set.  The "DTEND" property
      for a "VEVENT" calendar component specifies the non-inclusive end
      of the event.  For cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component
      specifies a "DTSTART" property with a DATE value type but no
      "DTEND" nor "DURATION" property, the event's duration is taken to
      be one day.  For cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component
      specifies a "DTSTART" property with a DATE-TIME value type but no
      "DTEND" property, the event ends on the same calendar date and
      time of day specified by the "DTSTART" property.

      The "VEVENT" calendar component cannot be nested within another
      calendar component.  However, "VEVENT" calendar components can be
      related to each other or to a "VTODO" or to a "VJOURNAL" calendar
      component with the "RELATED-TO" property.

   Example:  The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar
      component used to represent a meeting that will also be opaque to
      searches for busy time:

       BEGIN:VEVENT
       UID:19970901T130000Z-123401@example.com
       DTSTAMP:19970901T130000Z
       DTSTART:19970903T163000Z
       DTEND:19970903T190000Z
       SUMMARY:Annual Employee Review
       CLASS:PRIVATE
       CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
       END:VEVENT

      The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component
      used to represent a reminder that will not be opaque, but rather
      transparent, to searches for busy time:

       BEGIN:VEVENT
       UID:19970901T130000Z-123402@example.com
       DTSTAMP:19970901T130000Z
       DTSTART:19970401T163000Z
       DTEND:19970402T010000Z
       SUMMARY:Laurel is in sensitivity awareness class.
       CLASS:PUBLIC
       CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
       TRANSP:TRANSPARENT
       END:VEVENT

      The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component
      used to represent an anniversary that will occur annually:

       BEGIN:VEVENT
       UID:19970901T130000Z-123403@example.com
       DTSTAMP:19970901T130000Z
       DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:19971102
       SUMMARY:Our Blissful Anniversary
       TRANSP:TRANSPARENT
       CLASS:CONFIDENTIAL
       CATEGORIES:ANNIVERSARY,PERSONAL,SPECIAL OCCASION
       RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY
       END:VEVENT

      The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component
      used to represent a multi-day event scheduled from June 28th, 2007
      to July 8th, 2007 inclusively.  Note that the "DTEND" property is
      set to July 9th, 2007, since the "DTEND" property specifies the
      non-inclusive end of the event.

       BEGIN:VEVENT
       UID:20070423T123432Z-541111@example.com
       DTSTAMP:20070423T123432Z
       DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20070628
       DTEND;VALUE=DATE:20070709
       SUMMARY:Festival International de Jazz de Montreal
       TRANSP:TRANSPARENT
       END:VEVENT
