  tl;dr: "Classes" in JavaScript consist of a constructor function and prototype
  object that point to each other.

    // I'll be using the traditional OOP terminology of class/object here,
    // despite the fact that JavaScript doesn't use the concept of classes.
    // Hoping that by using this terminology it'll clarify the object model
    // for people coming from a traditional OOP background...
    // It's worth noting that the concept of classes may be coming sooner than we
    // think, though:
    // http://addyosmani.com/blog/a-few-new-things-coming-to-javascript/
    // But in the meantime, we do OOP via the constructor/prototype relationship.
    // So here we go...
    // Define a "class" called Employee.  Again, note that JavaScript doesn't have
    // any such thing as a class...yet.  So this is actually just an object, like
    // any other.
    var Employee = function()
    {
        // Let's add a default property to Employee.  Note that this is the WRONG
        // way to do it!  We'll illustrate why in a bit...
        this.company = "EA";
        // Maybe a bit presumptuous of me to assume everyone works at my company by
        // default...
    };
    // Let's add some more default properties to Employee.  This is the RIGHT way
    // to do it.  It's also our first exposure to prototype, a very important
    // concept in JavaScript OOP.
    Employee.prototype.division = "Sports";
    Employee.prototype.country  = "Canada";
    // Great!  Now let's create a helper function that prints out an employee.
    Employee.prototype.print = function()
    {
        var output =
                this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName + ', ' + // First the name
                this.division + ' division, ' +               // Then division
                this.company + ' ' + this.country + '.';       // Then company/location
        console.log(output);
    };
    // Now let's create a new object based off of our "class"...
    var steve = new Employee();
    // Looking good so far.  Now let's fill in my name:
    steve.firstName = "Steve";
    steve.lastName  = "Kwan";
    console.log("My employee object...");
    steve.print();
    console.log(''); // This is just for console display formatting
    // Output:
    // My employee object...
    // Steve Kwan, Sports division, EA Canada.
    // So far so good!  Now let's create another employee: my boss!
    var andrew       = new Employee();
    andrew.firstName = "Andrew";
    andrew.lastName  = "Wilson";
    // Only thing is, Andrew works in California.
    andrew.country = "USA";
    // Let's see what we've got!
    console.log("Steve and Andrew...");
    steve.print();
    andrew.print();
    console.log('');
    // Output:
    // Steve and Andrew...
    // Steve Kwan, Sports division, EA Canada.
    // Andrew Wilson, Sports division, EA USA.
    // Looking good so far!
    // ...Oops.  I realize I made a typo.  Our division isn't called "Sports"...
    // it's actually "EA SPORTS".  Common mistake:
    // http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcw_G0oK6Ns
    // While we're at it, let's also rename the company from EA to the proper
    // name, "Electronic Arts".
    // So let's change the default in our class definition and try again:
    Employee.company            = "Electronic Arts";
    Employee.prototype.division = "EA SPORTS"; // It's in the game!
    // And let's make sure our change took effect...
    console.log("After changing company and division...");
    steve.print();
    andrew.print();
    console.log('');
    // Output:
    // After changing company and division...
    // Steve Kwan, EA SPORTS division, EA Canada.
    // Andrew Wilson, EA SPORTS division, EA USA.
    // Uh oh.  The rename didn't work...at least, not completely.  The division
    // was properly renamed to "EA SPORTS", but the company name is still wrong.
    // Why?
    // Let's go back and take a look at how we declared those two defaults:
    // this.company = "EA";
    // Employee.prototype.division = "Sports";
    // The big difference is that division uses the prototype keyword.  And that's
    // the one that worked.
    // Welcome to object-oriented JavaScript.  :)
    // In more "sane" object-oriented languages, you create a class, you spawn
    // objects off of them, and you're done with it.  If you need to make a global
    // change you do it at the class level, and all instantiated objects pick up
    // that change automatically.  But JavaScript is NOT a "sane" object-oriented
    // language.
    // Instead, JavaScript uses what's called prototypal OOP.  For the best
    // possible explanation of how this stacks up to classical OOP, I recommend
    // reading The Good Parts, by Douglas Crockford:
    // http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do
    // In JavaScript, when you define a "class," you are actually just defining a
    // constructor function.  This is the function that gets called whenever you
    // use the var employee = new Employee() syntax.  Use of the new keyword tells
    // JavaScript to create a new object and invoke Employee as its constructor.
    // The important thing to note is that Employee is NOT actually a class!  It's
    // a regular object like any other.  It just happens to do double duty as a
    // constructor.  But you can assign and manipulate properties on it just like
    // any other object.  For example:
    Employee.favoriteFood = "Chicken";
    // And this change will NOT be propagated to all instances of Employee,
    // because they were already created long ago.
    console.log("What's my favorite food?");
    console.log(steve.favoriteFood);
    console.log('');
    // Output:
    // What's my favorite food?
    // undefined
    // See?  No chicken!
    // If you want to actually add something to a class definition so it affects
    // all instances, you put it in prototype:
    delete Employee.favoriteFood; // Get rid of the old one...
    Employee.prototype.favoriteFood = "Chicken";
    // Now let's try again...
    console.log("Delicious, delicious meat...");
    console.log(steve.favoriteFood);
    console.log('');
    // Output:
    // Delicious, delicious meat...
    // Chicken
    // So that begs the question...WTF is a prototype?
    // Whenever you define a function, it gets an automatically created property
    // called prototype.  The prototype property points to a special "prototype"
    // object, which is also automatically created with each function.  It is THAT
    // object that contains all the shared "members" for your "class."  Confused
    // yet?  :)
    // The important takeaway is: in other languages a class is a single thing,
    // but "class" definitions in JavaScript are split into TWO PARTS:
    // 1: The constructor (a plain old function), such as Employee
    // 2: The prototype, an automatically created object that every function gets.
    // So a "class" is actually TWO separate objects!
    // The constructor (or for that matter, any function) has an automatically-
    // created property called prototype, which points to an automatically-
    // created prototype object.
    // The prototype is an object automatically created for every function, and it
    // has an automatically-created attribute called constructor, which points
    // back to the constructor function.
    // Through these two properties, the two objects "link" to each other and are
    // able to provide constructor/property functionality.
    // To truly understand constructor and prototype - and the far more confusing
    // __proto__ property - I recommend reading this great article by Joost
    // Diepenmaat:
    // http://joost.zeekat.nl/constructors-considered-mildly-confusing.html
    // Anyway, now that we (hopefully) understand the relationship between
    // constructor and prototype, let's fix our example from before.
    delete Employee.company;                        // Remove from constructor
    Employee.prototype.company = "Electronic Arts"; // Put it in the right place
    // So let's check our changes...
    console.log("Checking our fix...");
    steve.print();
    andrew.print();
    console.log('');
    // Output:
    // Checking our fix...
    // Steve Kwan, EA SPORTS division, EA Canada.
    // Andrew Wilson, EA SPORTS division, EA USA.
    // Huh?  Why does the company name still say EA?  We deleted Employee.company.
    // What's going on?
    // The answer is actually pretty simple.  The line:
    // this.company = "EA";
    // Is in the constructor for Employee.  Whenever new Employee() is invoked,
    // that line is executed for the new Employee object being created.  And
    // because it uses the this keyword, it is binding the company property
    // TO THE NEW EMPLOYEE, not to the shared object.
    // So yes, we removed company from Employee...but we did it AFTER the
    // constructor had already been called.  Both the steve and andrew objects
    // wound up with their own company properties, which we now need to delete.
    // Let's clean that up.
    delete steve.company;
    delete andrew.company;
    // Now let's try again:
    console.log("FINALLY...");
    steve.print();
    andrew.print();
    console.log('');
    // Steve Kwan, EA SPORTS division, Electronic Arts Canada.
    // Andrew Wilson, EA SPORTS division, Electronic Arts USA.
    // Yay!
    // I hope this does a good job of explaining how JavaScript handles OOP via
    // the use of constructor and prototype.  This can be a real mind-bender for
    // someone coming from a classical OOP background in languages like Java.
    // I know I've already repeated this many times, but if you really want to
    // understand constructor and prototype, I highly recommend Joost's article:
