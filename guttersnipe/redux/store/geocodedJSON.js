All the refrigerated items were very cold and most items were not even expired. I didn't even look very thoroughly. Also, on a Tuesday or a Thursday night at about 9:45 p.m., I found bagels and flowers easily. The freegan group had also had good results at the old location.",

      "In the produce section, employees have plastic garbage bins that they drag around and go through the produce and throw out items here and there– anything with the slightest imperfection, sometimes stuff that's completely perfect. From my experience, if you eat it in the store, no one will bother you *though it's probably wise to stay near the bin you got it from to explain Comment: you got it if an employee asks*. If you intend to take it out, put it in a bag so you don't have to explain that you aren't stealing it. If you go to the back of the store, you will find the area employees go in and out of. If you go in there, as you walk in, on the facing wall are cardboard boxes filled with items pulled from the shelves. We've found that a good way to get the stuff and not have anyone bother you is to say you need a cardboard box if an employee asks why you are there, take one of the boxes, and then just fill it with stuff from the other boxes or take it out with Commentever is in it.
