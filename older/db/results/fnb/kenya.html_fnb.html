in Mountain View on June 14, 2008 and they shared their first meal on July 26, 2008. Doug spent no time in setting up a

classes in the slums of Kenya were impressive. The East Africa
Vegetarian Congress was to be held the first week of December. When I
was participating in the National Animal Rights Conference in Washington
D.C. I was introduced to Doctor Anteneh Roba of the International Fund
for Africa. He told me about the formation of an Ethiopian Vegan
Association and their interest in starting a Food Not Bombs group in
Addis Ababa.</font>

FACE="arial, helvetica"  color="#000000" SIZE=3>While I was on my fall tour he emailed to let me know about
Liladhar Bharadia and the East Africa Vegetarian Congress in Nairobi on
December 4th. Dr. Anteneh was able to secure funding for my plane ticket
from A Well Fed World and off I was on my way to Africa. My first visit
to Nairobi has been more successful then I had expected. Our coordinator
Douglas Rori made his room in Mountain View available to me. We started
our week with a meeting at the Artcafe in Westland. Doug told me that it
would be wise to register as an NGO and that he would provide me with a
copy of the requirements. He calculated the fees for the registration,
money needed to secure a bank account and mail box would total $700 U.S.
dollars.  We saw that the caf√© baked their own bread so we talked with
the manager and set up a time to pick up their unsold baked goods. After
the meeting we bought the food for Saturday&#39;s meal at the community
center Shangilia Youth 2 Youth Network in the Kibagare, Kangemi slum in
Nairobi. The rice, beans, oil, two large plastic buckets, large cooking
pot, and other items costing 4,000 shillings or $50 U.S. dollars. That
evening we soaked and cooked the beans. The city water was cut off to
our area of Nairobi soon after we started the beans so we were lucky.

cabbage and tomato dish and a huge pot of rice. Doug had to get
additional water from a storage tank near his mother&#39;s home. Doug called
a taxi and let the community center know we were about to leave. He also
called a photographer. The taxi took us to Artcafe where the employees
provided us with a large bag of artisan bread. Then we headed out to the
community center. The road through the &#34;commercial&#34; district of the slum
was very rough.

Once at the community center we were greeted by the
staff, a camera man from Film Aid and our photographer. The staff
announced the meeting. Around 100 children and teenagers  pushed into
the center. The staff helped us bring the food to a back room and we
posted the banners and place out the literature. Doug introduce me to
the children and staff and I told them a little about Food Not Bombs
then we  set out a table and brought out the rice, beans, vegetable stew
and bread from the library. The staff directed everyone to get in line
and we recruited volunteers to help share the food.  The youth glowed
with huge smiles and sparkling eyes which were so heart warming. We
shared the last of the food after about half an hour. We had enough for
everyone that attended. There was very little pushing and shoving but it
was clear towards the end that some of the children were worried we
would run out. The last couple of kids didn&#39;t get as much as I would
have liked to share with them. We visited with the children as they
played outside after eating. In the past Doug would teach classes on
photography and journalism after sharing the meal so I let the kids use
my camera to take pictures.

That same day local Kenya TV reported that Maasai land rights activist
Moses ole Mpoe was shot to death in Nakuru. His vehicle was sprayed with
bullets from an AK 47 while stuck in a traffic jam. Mpoe had been
working for the return of land taken away from the Maasai community
during the British colonial period. He was also a respected supervisor
on the Muthera Farm in Mau Narok, which is owned by the family of former
Kenyatta Cabinet minister Mbiyu Koinange. His murder sparked protests.
Douglas called the AK 47 &#34;Africa's weapon of mass distraction.&#34; That
same day six police officers were killed in Nairobi by what the police
claimed were terrorists. Over 130 people were arrested for illegally
sneaking into Kenya from Ethiopia and Somalia on their way to seek work
in South Africa and the Luis Moreno-Ocampo was in Nairobi to announce
that the International Criminal Court would name six suspects that would
face charges &#34;with crimes against humanity for their part in violence
that left more than 1,000 people dead after the disputed 2007
presidential election.&#34; Doug showed me a documentary by the Mars Group
Kenya that showed the corruption and causes of the post election
violence. I visited the website On December 15, 2010 but it was shut
down by December 27th.

Nairobi Food Not Bombs started in 2007 and has been providing meals to
young people in several poor areas of the city before teaching classes
in community journalism. Douglas Rori has been the coordinator since the
start of  Food Not Bombs in Kenya and has made many connections with
local community leaders in some of Nairobi&#39;s poorest areas. His students
have submitted a number of articles and photographs about the life in
the slums of Nairobi to Indykids in New York inspiring the children he
has been teaching and feeding to have greater self respect. One of the
children&#34;s articles reported on a story about how people collect trash
bags from the city dump. Empty the garbage and wash the trash bags in
the Nairobi River.</font>

literature and equipment, packed the taxi and returned to Mountain View
to clean the dishes and cooking equipment. We had to be careful with to
use our water as efficiently as possible.  We paid the taxi driver 4,000
shillings for the trip through Nairobi. We relaxed on Sunday morning and
then that afternoon we visited with Liladhar Bharadia, the director of
The Vegetarian Society of Kenya at the Artcafe. Mr. Bharada gave us a
tour of the Visa Oshawal Religious Center and introduced Doug and I to
their director and kitchen staff.  Mr. Bharadia also gave us documents
about the Vegetarian Congress in Nairobi to be held on December 18th and
the Middle Eastern Vegetarian Conference being held on December 7th and
8th.</font>

The next day we headed out to meet the Catherine Mugo Marketing Director
of one of  Kenya&#39;s largest groceries Nakumatt. We also met with Ameet
Shah and other staff members to talk about regular donations of food.
Catherine explained that their food was divided into cereals and
produce.  The company Fresh and Juicy provided all the produce. They
were very helpful and asked us to email them to share a bit about our
history and needs. We received a call from the director of the Nairobi
International School telling us that they had extra food so we agreed to
pick it up at noon. Doug called our taxi. We went to a bank where I
withdrew more money and we rushed to meet our taxi. We drove to the
Nairobi International School. The school donated about 100 paper bags of
food and a box of bananas. We stopped at Doug&#39;s house, picked up banners
and a camera. We rushed to the community center where we were treated to
acrobatic tricks by the children as we waited for the staff to bring the
key.

They arrived soon so we posted our banners, set up the chairs and
table for the food. We recruited a volunteer to help share the bagged
lunches and the staff organized the youth to get in line. The kids were
once again so kind and eager to get their meal. We had even more then
required so that was put aside and Doug and I returned with the taxi to
Westland to get some American money for the visa to Addis Ababa. Nairobi
Food Not Bombs is able to continue to provide vegan meals every Saturday
before their educational workshop rotating each week from one slum to
another returning once a month to each location.  It is urgent that we
raise the $700 necessary to register Nairobi Food Not Bombs as this
activity could be dangerous otherwise. Doug is a great asset. He lived
with his single mother in a poor area of Nairobi and with her work as a
school teacher and his ingenuity he was able to attend film school and
has become an accomplished journalist working for NGO&#39;s like Oxfam and
the United Nations. He is passing on the knowledge he learned to help
improve the lives of others in Kenya. The fact that he has already
achieved so much under such difficult conditions is truly amazing and it
was us an honor to work with him. The week long visit with Nairobi Food
Not Bombs and Douglas was a huge success.

Doug took me to the airport. Not an easy thing with a huge tractor trailer truck crashed across the highway. Even with the traffic jam we made it on time. After a short two hour flight on one of Ethiopia airlines new jets we arrived in Addis Ababa. As I was going through customs  to get our visa I told the officer that I was attending a conference hosted by the Ethiopia Vegan Association. That surprised the man behind me in line who remarked he was pleased to know their was such a movement. I told him I volunteered with Food Not Bombs and that farther interested him. I got my visa, picked up my bag at the carrousel and sure enough my hosts were there to pick me up. They were all smiles and so welcoming. The drive to the Ras Hotel was quick. My bank card didn't work but fortunately I had $25 U.S. and they took that for the evening. The room was on the Nelson Mandela floor and a photo of a jail cell with the words Nelson Mandela's cell for 27 years hung outside my room 210. The room was fantastic. New washroom fixtures and two comfortable single beds. A complex shower and a TV with four channels one of which was tuned to the BBC news. After being so careful with the water in Nairobi  the hot shower seemed like a blessing.
