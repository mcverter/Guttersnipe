Everything should be working well.
I am pretty sure it works okay on limit cases too ( distance = 0) but I haven't tested this extensively.

You MUST extract the slider in the tar file.

Please contact me if you have any problems with this.  It works on my machine and on the linux labs.  It should work on your machine too.


Thanks
