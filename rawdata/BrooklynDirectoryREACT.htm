            <strong>When to look: </strong> 8:45 when all the employees leave the store. Trash is collected between 10:30 p and 12:30a. One source says nothing is out on Saturdays.
            <comment>
              <strong>What You&#8217;ll Find:</strong> Lots of locals count on finding greens and produce in particular. Fewer go thru the bags, which contain health bread, and often assorted packaged health foods, and small amounts of bulk foods (grains, beans, nuts, coffee) that can be gleaned from the not-quite-emptied heavy brown bags.

          <comment>Dumpster divers from all 4 boroughs have been known to make the trip. On some nights TJ&#8217;s puts out upwards of 6 dumpsters, at least half of which are filled top to bottom with quality food. Sometimes the scene gets weirdly competitive, with dumpster divers seeming to forget that the area is packed with other wasteful stores.</comment>
          <comment><strong>When:</strong> Lately (fall 2012), usually not until about midnight; sometimes earlier. Be forewarned, the initial reaction of this store&#8217;s management was to have the police ticket dumpster divers for trespass or littering; the situation could always take a turn for the worse.</comment>

          Marsha offers this local info in March 2012: &#8220;Out front features the usual assortment of vegetables, fruits, et al. They put out a wheeled trash container filled with discarded produce. During the day, this trash bin is tied tightly with twine and they wouldn&#8217;t appreciate it being cut. However, late at night, the twine is removed. I have dug through it after 10 and 11 p.m. to find it loaded with cast-off lettuce leaves, lemons, limes, oranges, mangoes, tomatoes, bananas, apples, bundles of mint, parsley, etc. The nearby cardboard boxes also often have discarded produce.  So far, the manager doesn&#8217;t give me any trouble when I dig through it so it might be worth a try for others.&#8221;

          <strong>Where/How to get stuff:</strong> As late at night as you can stand, on E 12th Street, big black plastic bags. This store stays open very late and some of the managers will diligently shoo you away. They throw out huge quantities of produce, seemingly entire cases of stuff not up to their standard. My partner and I have made gallons of cider from a single night&#8217;s pickup of apples and pears, for instance. Other typical mass dumps include bananas and tomatoes. Be prepared to can, dry, freeze or ferment.

          Raven reported in March 2012: &#8220;The first bag we opened was FULL of nothing but packaged boxes of organic cookies, gluten free cookie, gourmet packaged tortas. It was too good not to take everything which was an unbelievable amount. So much that right now I&#8217;m going to go give some away. We must have salvaged over $200 worth of stuff, perfectly good, no expiration date, not stale food!&#8221;

          <comment> <strong>Where/How to Get Stuff:</strong> This is a very old report (pre-2005) but the technique described is an interesting one for any gigantic store whose food is usually inaccessible because of compactors.</comment>

          <comment>&#8220;In the produce section, employees have plastic garbage bins that they drag around and go through the produce and throw out items here and there&#8211; anything with the slightest imperfection, sometimes stuff that&#8217;s completely perfect. From my experience, if you eat it in the store, no one will bother you (though it&#8217;s probably wise to stay near the bin you got it from to explain how you got it if an employee asks). If you intend to take it out, put it in a bag so you don&#8217;t have to explain that you aren&#8217;t stealing it. If you go to the back of the store, you will find the area employees go in and out of. If you go in there, as you walk in, on the facing wall are cardboard boxes filled with items pulled from the shelves. We&#8217;ve found that a good way to get the stuff and not have anyone bother you is to say you need a cardboard box if an employee asks why you are there, take one of the boxes, and then just fill it with stuff from the other boxes or take it out with whatever is in it. You can then walk right out of the store without anyone bothering you.&#8221;</comment>
          <comment><strong>When to Go There:</strong> During store hours. Probably not too early in the day, but I&#8217;m not really sure if there is a best time.</comment>
          <comment><strong>What You Can Get:</strong> Varies widely, but including packaged and loose produce.</comment>

          This is the legendary juice dumpster; one editor of this site stumbled upon it in June 2012. In the late afternoon of a weekday, the gate was open and the dumpster chock full of everything from pomegranate juice to lemonade to smoothies and lattes. Everything was acceptably cool; no bottles were bloated. Some were way past &#8220;pull date&#8221;.

It could be that the store stopped doing soups or some other kind of prepared food, or the dry goods in question had been on the shelf a long time. The outsides of containers had that old stickiness like they had sat on a shelf above a stove for many moons. But worth checking back.

        <shareable>2nd location: Union Avenue at Metropolitan (right by the Lorimer St. stop on the L)
          Needs to be scouted more.
          Both store are open 24 hours a day, so they&#8217;re not for the shy.

          We recently (November 2011) met at this store, which has a few inside tables and loud TV.  They do toss bagels, somewhat erratically.

            21 Manhattan Ave, near Lorimer J&amp;M stop; trash in parking lot on Broadway
          </address>
          <strong>When to Look:</strong> Needs more exploration, but on our midweek trailblaze food was out at 10pm.
          <strong>Where to Look:</strong>Several large dumpsters in the east corner of the parking lot, the corner farthest away from the store itself. There are gates, but left open. Veggies, herbs, fruit, meats and cheeses, junk food and more.
