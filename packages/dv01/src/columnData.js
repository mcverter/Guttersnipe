After having a great experience with Lending Club with higher interest rate debt, I am applying for a loan to pay off my lower interest rate debts. <br><br>For this loan:<br>$3768 at 10.24%...$75 per month <br>$4794 at 8.99%...$188 per month <br><br>Other info:<br>Current LC Loan  - Approx. $9000 at 8.88% - $381 per month  <br>House/Rent/Car $0.00...paid off<br>Minimal student loan payment at 3.99% (of course not consolidating)<br>Utilities...minimal<br><br>Taking on this loan is more than comparable to the bills I have been paying and my debt will be payed off in 36 months. I would rather pay interest to you then them. Thank you very much for your consideration!!<br><br>","credit_card","After Great Experience I am Back Again","211xx","MD","17.71","0","Sep-1998","0","","","7","0","9466","35.9%","19","f","0.00","0.00","9782.190000654098","9782.19","8850.00","932.19","0.0","0.0","0.0","Jan-2015","5.67","","Dec-2018","0","","1","Individual","","","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cash","N","","","","","",""],
