    <h2>Grid Options</h2>

    <p>
        Each grid needs to be provided with a set of grid options. All the possible
        parameters for the grid options are listed below with a brief description.
        Full details of the options can be found in the relevant sections.
    </p>

    <p>
        Where the value is a boolean (true or false), then false (or leave blank) is the default value.
        For this reason, on / off items are presented in such was as the most common usage is
        false, eg suppressCellSelection is worded as such as most people will want cell selection
        to be turned on.
