    <h2>Web Components</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="http://webcomponents.org/">Web Components</a> are reusable user interface widgets that are created using open Web technology. They are
        part of the browser and so they do not depend on external libraries such as AngularJS or JQuery.
    </p>
    <p>
        Web Components are of particular interest to Angular Grid as I see them as the future. They will also
        pave the way for Angular 2 integration, as Angular 2 reusable widgets is based around Web Component
        technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        Angular Grid and Web Components is work in progress. This page shows how Angular Grid currently works
        with Web Components. However I expect changes to be made here as I more tightly integrate the Angular Grid
        interface into the expectations around Web Components and also make it work well with Angular 2.
    </p>
    <note>
        Web components are an emerging technology and not available in all browsers. Some browsers lacking support
        can be plugged using polyfills. The examples on this page use
        <a href="http://cdnjs.com/libraries/webcomponentsjs">webcomponent.js</a>
        polyfill from Google. The examples on this page have been tested to work with latest versions of Chrome
        and Firefox on Windows. They failed using IE 11 and Safari on Windows. I have not done extensive testing
        on which browsers Web Components as what browsers support Web Components and which don't is not a grid
        problem / discussion, it's specific to Web Components. If you are going to use Web Components in your
        application, then which browsers your application will run on is a big question you need to answer for
        yourself.

    <h4>Using Angular Grid Web Component</h4>

    <p>
        Angular Grid registers as a tag named 'agile-grid' (Angular Grid will renamed to Agile Grid in the
        coming weeks). To insert a grid into your application, use the agile-grid tag and then provide the grid
        options through Javascript.
    </p>

    <p>
        HTML Code:
        <pre><code>&lt;agile-grid id="myAgileGrid">&lt;/agile-grid></code></pre>
        Javascript Code:<br/>
    <pre><code>var myAgileGrid = document.querySelector('#myAgileGrid');
myAgileGrid.setGridOptions(gridOptions);</code></pre>
    </p>

    <h4>Simple Example</h4>

    <p>
        The example below shows a simple grid using Web Components.
    </p>

    <show-example example="example1" example-height="160px"></show-example>

    <h4>Complex Example</h4>

    <p>
        The example below shows a complex grid using Web Components.
