e FROM THE FARM 

New Yorkers can access foods straight from the farm in two ways: farmers' markets and community supported agriculture programs 
or CSAs. 
FARMERS' MARKETS 
All farmers' markets listed accept EBT/SNAP (food stamps). 
77 Jamaica Friday Down to Earth Farmers' Market 
Parsons Blvd. between Archer and Jamaica Ave .. 11432 
Fri 8:30am-4pm, Jun-Nov 
78 Jamaica Saturday Down to Earth Farmers' Market 
160th St. & Jamaica Ave .. 11432 
Sat 8:30am-4pm, Jun-Nov 
79 Edgemere Farm Market 
Beach Channel Dr. and Beach 45 St., 11691 
Sat, Sun 9am-2pm, May-Oct 
CSA PROGRAMS 
CSA members purchase "shares" in an entire season of high quality, fresh produce grown by local farmers. Members usually pay for their shares in advance, but some CSAs adjust payment to income, ac­cept SNAP benefits, and allow some members to pay week to week. Members typically pick up boxes of produce from a set location every week though some CSAs have half-shares available for pick up every other week. 
Note that sign up is generally March to May, with the first pickup in June or July and the last one in late October or early November. As a rule, late sign up is not permitted. Some CSAs also have limited winter shares. 
IINeighborhood Guide to Food and Assistance -Eastern Queens Edition 
Corbin Hill 
Multiple pickup locations. Allows signups Tuesday/Wednesday before 
first pickup. Permits weekly payment and payment via SNAP. Weekly in 
summer, every other week in winter. Reduced price shares available.
