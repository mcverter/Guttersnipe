CSA ProGrAMS 
CSA members purchase "shares" in an entire season of high quality, fresh produce grown by local farmers. Members usually pay for their shares in advance, but some CSAs adjust payment to income, ac­cept SNAP benefits, and allow some members to pay week to week. Members typically pick up boxes of produce from a set location every week though some CSAs have half-shares available for pick up every other week. 
Note that sign up is generally March to May, with the first pickup in June or July and the last one in late October or early November. As a rule, late sign up is not permitted. Some CSAs also have limited winter shares. 
Corbin Hill 
Multiple pickup locations. Allows signups Tuesday/Wednesday before first pickup. Permits weekly payment and payment via SNAP. Weekly in summer, every other week in winter. Reduced price shares available. Visit Corbin Hill's website, call, or email to find a CSA program near you and sign up. 
Contact: info@corbinhillfarm.com, 646 254 2250 web: www.corbinhillfoodproject.org/new-farm-share/ 
Just Food 
Multiple pickup locations. Sign up deadlines and SNAP acceptance vary. Winter shares available from some CSAs. Visit Just Food's website, call, or email to find a CSA program near you. Contact the CSA directly to sign up.
