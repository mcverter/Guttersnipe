              <CommentText> Lots of locals count on finding greens and produce in particular. Fewer go thru the bags, which contain health bread, and often assorted packaged health foods, and small amounts of bulk foods (grains, beans, nuts, coffee) that can be gleaned from the not-quite-emptied heavy brown bags.</CommentText>

          <Comment>Dumpster divers from all 4 boroughs have been known to make the trip. On some nights TJ's puts out upwards of 6 dumpsters, at least half of which are filled top to bottom with quality food. Sometimes the scene gets weirdly competitive, with dumpster divers seeming to forget that the area is packed with other wasteful stores.</Comment>
          <Time>Lately (fall 2012), usually not until about midnight; sometimes earlier. Be forewarned, the initial reaction of this store's management was to have the police ticket dumpster divers for trespass or littering; the situation could always take a turn for the worse.</Time>

              <CommentText>  For those on bicycle or who don't mind a little walk, this is a great alternative to the Trader Joe's at Atlantic and Court. It's a high-end supermarket mini-chain that is just far enough from other stores that it gets few dumpster divers. Finds have included loads of packaged and unpackaged bread, produce, dairy products, quarts of prepared soup (generally not vegetarian), fancy desserts, fancy fresh pasta.</CommentText>

              <CommentText>  As late at night as you can stand, on E 12th Street, big black plastic bags. This store stays open very late and some of the managers will diligently shoo you away. They throw out huge quantities of produce, seemingly entire cases of stuff not up to their standard. My partner and I have made gallons of cider from a single night's pickup of apples and pears, for instance. Other typical mass dumps include bananas and tomatoes. Be prepared to can, dry, freeze or ferment.</CommentText>

            <Comment>Raven reported in March 2012: &#8220;The first bag we opened was FULL of nothing but packaged boxes of organic cookies, gluten free cookie, gourmet packaged tortas. It was too good not to take everything which was an unbelievable amount. So much that right now I'm going to go give some away. We must have salvaged over $200 worth of stuff, perfectly good, no expiration date, not stale food!&#8221;</Comment>

              <CommentText>  High-end supermarket mini-chain. The Union St location is brightly lit and is frequented by neighborhood dumpster divers. The south slope location is on a dark and quiet stretch and does not seem to be well known to dumpster divers. Finds at both stores (and the Court St location) have included loads of packaged and unpackaged bread, produce, dairy products, quarts of prepared soup (generally not vegetarian), fancy desserts, fancy fresh pasta.</CommentText>

              <CommentText>  We don't know this location very well; needs more exploration. On latest visit (Jan 2011), some produce and bakery goods, but hard to get at. Location is super well lit, there is a lot of foot traffic and there is not much room to work, as the dumpsters are directly outside the store entrance.</CommentText>

              <CommentTitle>Where to Look:</CommentTitle>
              <CommentText> Several large dumpsters in the east corner of the parking lot, the corner farthest away from the store itself. There are gates, but left open. Veggies, herbs, fruit, meats and cheeses, junk food and more.</Comment>
