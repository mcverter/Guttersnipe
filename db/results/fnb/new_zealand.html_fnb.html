  Christchurch FNBS organises a Really Free Market, Bi-Monthly at Latimer
Square, currently the second Saturday of every second month. We now have a three wheeler bike and large bike trailer that are to be purpose built to use as a mobile kitchen.<br>
  Christchurch FNBs also does meals at events like Hiroshima Day,J-Day {day of
action against prohibition of Cannabis & all drugs},ANZ Bank out of Iraq
actions at ANZ banks. We also are attempting to have regular meals on the
streets in Cashel Mall at lunch times on Friday but this is dependant on
volunteers.   We fed the Anti- Capitalist Art Exhibition called &#34;Upping the
ANTI&#34;.This event is a Benefit for FNBs and will also be our first BREW
NOT BOMBS. We are open to ideas for actions and are keen to cook whenever
we can.<br></font>
