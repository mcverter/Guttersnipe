Hi there, thanks for contacting Google Play Developer Support!

There will be a short survey at the end of our chat so you can provide feedback on the service I'm providing.

How can I help you today?
Mitchell Verter12:35 PM
Hi. I am trying to add a new release for Guttersnpe
Mitchell Verter12:35 PM
the current one crashes
Mitchell Verter12:35 PM
When I upload
Mitchell Verter12:35 PM
Upload failed
You uploaded an APK that is not signed with the upload certificate. You must use the same certificate. The upload certificate has fingerprint:
[ SHA1: 57:F8:EE:36:DE:73:88:B4:CB:75:BB:8F:99:AF:70:85:9B:06:F3:A8 ]
and the certificate used to sign the APK you uploaded have fingerprint:
[ SHA1: 2E:06:CF:27:6C:5D:0F:D2:07:15:2B:6F:15:5D:F1:F5:4D:14:59:2A ]

You need to use a different version code for your APK or Android App Bundle because you already have one with version code 1.
Mitchell Verter12:35 PM
let me see something ...
Mitchell Verter12:36 PM
i can't specify the version from the console, can i?
Pete12:37 PM
No, you can't. Your version code is controlled by your app's manifest file.

You also need to use the same certificate to sign your update that you used to sign the first release.
Mitchell Verter12:37 PM
ok
Mitchell Verter12:37 PM
i do not have the same certificate
Mitchell Verter12:37 PM
that is gone
Mitchell Verter12:38 PM
is there anyting i can do?
Pete12:38 PM
Fortunately, you're enrolled in Google Play App Signing, so we can reset your upload cert. You'll need to generate a .pem file for me first, though. Once we're done chatting, I will email you the instructions to reset your key. Can I reach you at mitchell.verter@gmail.com?
Mitchell Verter12:39 PM
ok
Mitchell Verter12:39 PM
yes
Pete12:39 PM
Right on. Can I help with anything else before I end the chat and send the instructions?
Mitchell Verter12:40 PM

Pete12:40 PM
You're welcome. Have a nice day!
